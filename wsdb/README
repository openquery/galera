This directory contains both wsdb library and
clones replication library. Clones is just a 
work name for the library until the final library 
name will be fixed.

There is only one makefile, which builds both wsdb
and clones libraries. There are autoconf/make files
also, but they should not be used yet.

wsdb - write set database
  C library for managing write sets of some transaction
  processing system.

  wsdb builds into libwsdb.a, wsdb_api.h declares all 
  public objects.

clones - application replication library
  clones.c and clones.h constitute the replication 
  layer on top of libwsdb and libgcs. 
  makefile builds libclones.o, which is relocatable
  object file linked with libwsdb.a and libgcs.a.
  libclones.o exports symbols from clones.h and should
  be linked with the application using clones.h.

Subdirectory test contains check unit tests for libwsdb.
There is a makefile, which builds into wsdb_test.
You can run tests simply by:
  $ cd test
  $ make
  $ make test
Test directory has further subdirectory: data, which stores
files used during test runs.

Clones has some hard coded configurations. One important
configuration parameter is the work directory, which
is by default: 

  /var/lib/mysql/clones

You should create this directory and make sure it is
writeable by the application linking with libclones.o
