/*!
 * Job queue abstraction
 * 
 * Job queue holds information of workers and jobs
 * assigned for the workers. Each worker can execute
 * one job at a time. 
 * 
 * Job queue is created and removed with job_queue_create() 
 * and job_queue_destroy(). Reference to job queue must be
 * passed to all subsequent job queue calls.
 * The create function requires a conflict resolution function
 * handle. Application must implement this function to determine
 * if two given jobs can be executed parallelly.
 *
 * Workers register themselves with job_queue_new_worker()
 * method. They receive worker handle, which must be passed to
 * all subsequent job queue calls.
 * 
 * Worker starts a job with job_queue_start_job() call. Job queue
 * finds all jobs, which are running at the moment, and verifies
 * with each of them, if the new job can be started parallelly. 
 * The application call back is used for this conflict resolution.
 * If there is no conflict, function returns immediately. If there
 * is a conflict, the function call blocks until all conflicting
 * jobs have ended.
 *
 * Worker ends a job by job_queue_end_job() call. This will signal
 * all workers, which are conflicting with the ending job to continue.
 */

/*
 * @brief checks if two jobs can run in parallel
 * Functions is passed two job context pointers.
 * The function is supposed to tell, if the first
 * job can run together with the second job.
 *
 * @param ctx1 context for job 1, this is tested 
 * @param ctx2 context for job 2, wich is already running
 * @return 1, if job1 can be started, 0 otherwise
