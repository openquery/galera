This directory contains all wsdb unit tests.
Tests are written with check utility. All modules, which
have some tests should have corresponding test_'module'.c
in this directory.

wsdb_test.c is the test main function, which calls each
test_* tests.

subdirectory data is for temporary test data files, nothing
care about.

The makefile builds into wsdb_test. Just run ./wsdb_test to
see how we are doing today...
